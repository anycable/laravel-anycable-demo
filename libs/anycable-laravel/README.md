# AnyCable Laravel Broadcaster

A Laravel broadcaster implementation to use [AnyCable](https://anycable.io/) as a WebSocket server.

The broadcaster allows you to use AnyCable as a drop-in replacement for Reverb, or Reverb, or whatever is supported by Laravel Echo. By "drop-in", we mean that no client-side changes required to use AnyCable, all you need is to update the server configuration (and, well, launch an AnyCable server).

> [!TIP]
> The quickest way to get started with AnyCable server is to use our free managed offering: [plus.anycable.io](https://plus.anycable.io)

> [!NOTE]
> The AnyCable Laravel support is still in its early days. Please, let us know if anything goes wrong. See also the [limitations](#limitations) section below.

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require anycable/laravel-broadcaster
```

## Configuration

First, add the AnyCable provider to the `bootstrap/providers.php` file:

```diff
 <?php
 
 return [
     App\Providers\AppServiceProvider::class,
     // ...
+    AnyCable\Laravel\Providers\AnyCableBroadcastServiceProvider::class,
 ];
```

Then, add the following to your `config/broadcasting.php` file:

```php
'anycable' => [
    'driver' => 'anycable',
],
```

That's a minimal configuration, all AnyCable related parameters would be inferred from the default env. This is our default config:

```php
'anycable' => [
    'secret' => env('ANYCABLE_SECRET', null),
    'http_broadcast_url' => env('ANYCABLE_HTTP_BROADCAST_URL', null),
    'timeout' => env('ANYCABLE_BROADCAST_TIMEOUT', 5) // timeout for broadcast HTTP requests
]
```

Your client-side Echo configuration can stay almost unchanged (in case you used Reverb):

```js
import Echo from "laravel-echo";

// We use Pusher protocol for now
import Pusher from "pusher-js";
window.Pusher = Pusher;

window.Echo = new Echo({
    broadcaster: "reverb", // reverb or pusher would work
    key: "reverb", // MUST be 'reverb' — that's how AnyCable understands that the request is coming from a Laravel app
    wsHost: import.meta.env.VITE_REVERB_HOST,
    wsPort: import.meta.env.VITE_REVERB_PORT ?? 80,
    wssPort: import.meta.env.VITE_REVERB_PORT ?? 443,
    forceTLS: (import.meta.env.VITE_REVERB_SCHEME ?? "https") === "https",
    enabledTransports: ["ws", "wss"],
});
```

Just make sure you point to to the AnyCable server (locally it runs on the same host and port as Reverb).

## Usage

You can use Laravel's broadcasting features as you normally would:

```php
MyEvent::dispatch($data);
```

See [Broadcasting documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/12.x/broadcasting).

### Private Channels

AnyCable supports private channels. To use them, you need to set the `ANYCABLE_SECRET` environment variable.

Then, don't forget to add authorization callbacks like this:

```php
Broadcast::channel('private-channel', function ($user) {
    return true;
});
```
